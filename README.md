# Peer Review 13
#### Dabbling with CoreAudio using AVFoundation and AudioToolBox.
##### This project is 13/15 Peer Review projects done in the course \"iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs\" by UCI.

___
Building a application with 4 different audio effects, and a background sound track.

```
The soundtrack for background is not added to the project repository, 
because it is a song and may attract some action. 
	So use your own songs for background.
```
The app has 4 different UIButtons, each playing a saperate audio effect all marked by, 1,2,3 & 4. There is a *Play* and a *Pause* which plays the background soundtrack (not included).
The *UIButton*s 1,2,3 & 4 triggers an *AudioToolBox* playback of the soundeffects. 

The *Play* & *Pause* buttons are used to interact with *AVFoundation/AVAudioPlayer* which has the background music track.
